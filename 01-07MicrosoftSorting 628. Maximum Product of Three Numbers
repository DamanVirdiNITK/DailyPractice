####1st Method
Brute Force
Find all the triplets and then max of all
Time Complexity O(n3)
Space Complexity O(1)


####2nd Method
SORT the array/list. Two possibilites of MAX product is : all 3 greatest positive or 2 least and one max positive

class Solution:
    def maximumProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()
        return max(nums[0]*nums[1]*nums[n-1] , nums[n-1]*nums[n-2]*nums[n-3] )
        
Time Complexity O(nlogn)   (for Sorting)
Space Complexity O(logn)   (for Sorting)


###3rd Methods
Instead of sorting. Find all 2 smallest and 3 largest numbers in SINGLE SCAN and then find max as in prev method
